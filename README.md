# horiseon_sss_landingpage

## Description

The objective of this project is to learn how I can enhance someone's existing code and provide the following:
* semantic HTML elements
* logical layout and structure of the web page
* provide accessible alt attributes that describes images that may not be operating
* update headings and titles to provide the proper organization and understanding of each section

I was most looking forward to the organization and semantics that websites use and how I can improve/decrease the amount of code. Learning to reduce the amount of code will help me learn how to properly utilize each element, class, ID, and pseudo-class. In addition, this project forces me to be concise and descriptive. Refactoring someone else's code gives me the chance to learn how other web developers have structured other website and how html and css have changed over time. 

I believe my updated code allows for more accessibility and also increases the reachability of my projects by providing accurate headers, text, and elements. 

Here is a screenshot of the website based on my code:

## How to use my projects

Others after me who will be learning web development can see the process and steps I have taken in order to help improve my own skills. Looking through Github and my repositories can show how I have learned from others and my own mistakes. 

## Credits

This project was possible through UCSD Extension; my instructor: Jeslyn; my TAs: Ava and Anthony; and my classmates who are also taking this course. In addition, my wife, who is taking the Data Sciences Program has also helped me with understanding git.
